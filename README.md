# S.tragus-abioticStress-RNAseq

## Differential expression pipeline

The pipeline scripts were adapted from scripts found Erin Nishimura's repository erinosb/2023_RNAseq_pairedend.  

Major adaptations include substituting STAR for Hisat2 during alignment. 

## DESeq2 Scripts 

The DESeq2 scripts for this analysis were adapted from the RNA sequencing course offered at Colorado State University. The original author is Dr. Erin Nishimura (@erinosb).

This script was highly edited to accomidate the _Salsola tragus_ abiotic stress analysis.
